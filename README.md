# songSearch

## Premise

In this project, you will build a React web application. You will use your knowledge of React components, passing state, and requests with the Spotify API to build a website that allows users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account.

## Version 1

Upon accessing the website, the user is met with the Spotify authorization page. The user logs in to their Spotify account and provides the app permission to access and post to the account

Upon providing permission, the user will be redirected to the app home. They are presented with 3 columns. The column farthest to the left presents to the user a list of playlist that they have already created. The second column (middle) provides the user with the ability to search via artists, albums or track names via the Spotify API. And lastly, the third column is used to construct basic playlists.

After the user searches, 20 of the most relevant matches are displayed. The user can scroll and read the basic descriptions for each match. The user can click on the plus icon (+) to add the track to the third column (playlist builder).

Once the tracks are added to the playlist builder, the user can either remove the added tracks from the playlist or once satisified save the playlist to their Spotify account. 

Once saved the user has saved the playlist, they can return to the device that holds their Spotify app and enjoy the playlist.
